# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem Statement

Players want a satisfying, replayable RPG loop with class identity, loot progression, and tactical combat inspired by classic MMO/RTS RPGs, but without requiring online matchmaking or large time commitments.

## Target Users

- Solo players who enjoy loot-driven progression and character builds.
- Fans of stylized fantasy combat and party-based tactics.
- Players who want short, repeatable runs with meaningful meta progression.

## Key Features

- Procedural world generation with biomes, dungeons, and hubs.
- Class-based combat with distinct roles (tank, healer, damage).
- Loot and crafting loops; equipment rarity and affixes.
- Quest and event systems that adapt to run length.
- Meta progression: unlocks, talent trees, and account-wide upgrades.
- Later: drop-in/out co-op, but singleplayer parity first.

## Core User Flows

- Start a run -> choose class -> spawn in hub.
- Explore overworld -> enter dungeon -> fight bosses -> extract loot.
- Return to hub -> craft/upgrade -> choose next run modifiers.

## Success Criteria

- Players can complete a full 15-30 minute run without blockers.
- Clear class identity and gear progression within the first hour.
- Run variety: at least 3 distinct biome/dungeon combinations.
- Stable 60 FPS on target hardware for current content.

## Near-Term Prototype Plan

- Introduce data-driven items with inventory/equipment.
- Add a basic weapon (sword) that modifies attack power.
- Surface attack power in the HUD to validate progression.
- Add a skill tree UI with unlockable skills to validate class progression.
